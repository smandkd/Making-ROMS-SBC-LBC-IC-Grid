This repository is for making IC, LBC, SBC, Grid input files for ROMS modeling based on KIM's works. https://blog.dhkim.info/ROMS_Tutor/. Thanks for Prof Kim.

pyroms is hard to use and install, so if you are struggled with that, than see my codes and copy import parts. The following conda packeges are needed to use pyroms.

numpy=1.22.4 scipy gridgen esmf matplotlib basemap netcdf4 cftime lpsolve55 xarray

Thanks for Ger Anne Marie, my collegue. 

This codes must be carried on Linux, GPU, and CPU cluster.

Also recommened to use Tmux for Linux.
